## Project 
Restaurant Item-Level Rating Application

## What and Why? 
This application will allow users to rate individual items at restaurants. There are two current problem with review systems like Google Reviews (which is excellent) and Yelp: (1) you can rate restaurants but not individual food items, and (2) people don't know what's "the best" thing to order at a restaurant unless by word of mouth. On the first point, critically, things such as service and ambience will lower the overall rating of the restaurant even if the food is fire (delicious). Our application solves this problem by focusing our ratings exclusively on the dishes themselves. On the second point, our application enables users, before going to or at a restaurant, to quickly lookup the best-rated items. 

## For Whom? 
Our target market is foodies. Additionally, given that our application allows pre-planning, this app is helpful for those with social anxiety.

## How?
From the perspective of the end-user, there are two functions: (1) to lookup a restaurant and view the best-rated (and worst-rated) items on the menu, and (2) to lookup a restaurant and review items on the menu.
As user-driven app, the user would be able to add a restaurant that does not yet exist on the app. To avoid duplicates and distinguish chain-based restaurants' locations, we propose to use Google's Place API in conjunction with the user's location and text input to determine the correct location. Hence, from the user's perspective, the process of looking up a restaurant is as easy as typing the restaurant name and selecting the correct result.
Additional features would include an average rating per menu item for browsing reviews, and image-adding functionality for writing reviews. 

## Scope
GoTeam Developers will create the application for Resy that will include all necessary algorithms and data to provide users with a menu item recommendation platform. This app feature includes data regarding restaurants, menus, menu items, and user types.
