# Project Proposal

***Team***: Christina Borao, James Galbraith, Janak Balar

***Project Title***: Restaurant Menu Item Rating Application Feature

***What and Why?***: This application feature will allow users to rate food items at restaurants they have been to. Our target market is foodies. Our application aims to enable users to recommend dishes to others based on their experience. Individuals can plan out their order before going to the restaurant and look forward to the meal they will soon have.

***For Whom?***: Our target market is foodies. Additionally, given that our application allows pre-planning, this app is helpful for those with social anxiety.

***How?***: Places API, etc... (finish later)

***Scope***: GoTeam Developers will create the application feature for Resy that will include all necessary algorithms and data to provide users with a menu item recommendation platform. This app feature includes data regarding restaurants, menus, menu items, and user types.
